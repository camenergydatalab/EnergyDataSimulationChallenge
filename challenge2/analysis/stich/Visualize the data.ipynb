The peak at 11 hours can be attributed to the human diurnal rhythm, whereas the peaks at 21, 24, and 27 hours are most likely related to the daily pattern of behavior. The next peak at 33 hours is probably attributable to the diurnal pattern as 33 hours is roughly 1.5 * 24.

Its mean are ~510 and its standard deviation ~789. The large standard deviation is related to the fact that the tail of the distribution is heavier than one would initially suspect. Arguably the events in the tail are what are most interesting to electricity providers as they have to be able to supply sufficient electricity even during a sudden rise in consumption."
